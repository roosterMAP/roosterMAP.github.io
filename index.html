<p class="dateline">A few weeks ago, I saw an increadible demo from a YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrv269YwJzuZL3dH5PCgxUw">CodeParade</a> making a Devlog for his indie game Hyperbolica. It featured a first person world that existed on the hyperbolic or eliptical plane. Traversing the plane looked disorienting and mindbending. I was fascinated by how space seemed to unfold before the player when traversing the hyperbolic plane. It inspired my to have a closer look at the math behind this demo and perhapse do my own implementation. But that's for another time. This post will specifically go over how points from 3D Euclidean space are mapped to Hyperbolic space with the Poincar&eacute; ball model.</p>
